    "# Architectural Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "- Principals are guides, not rules\n",
    "\n",
    "## Separation of concerns (SoC)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Seperate software into logic components \n",
    "- Applies to all levels of design and architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "## Don’t repeat yourself (DRY)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Eliminate redunancy \n",
    "- Encapsulate duplicate logic into a reusable component\n",
    "- Keep SoC principal in mind when refactoring for DRY\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keep it simple, stupid (KISS)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advocates for simple designs and solutions\n",
    "- Choose the simplest solution possible\n",
    "- Eliminate complexity\n",
    "- Predicting future requirments can be detrimental to design (Over Architecting)\n",
    "\n",
    "## You Aren’t Gonna Need It (YAGNI)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not add features or functionality based on speculation\n",
    "- Design the minimal amount needed to meet requirments\n",
    "- Relates to the KISS principal\n",
    "- Be agile and flexible to intermittently adapt and evolve as needs emerge\n",
    "\n",
    "## The SOLID principles\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLID is an acronym for 5 principles\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single responsibility principle\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single class should hold 1 and only 1 responsibility (Only 1 reason to change)\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this example, Public and Prviate projects are 2 responsibilities and can be seperated into `PulicProdctReader` and `PrivateProductReader` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```csharp\n",
    "    namespace BeforeSRP;\n",
    "    public class ProductRepository\n",
    "    {\n",
    "    public ValueTask<Product> GetOnePublicProductAsync(int productId)\n",
    "    => throw new NotImplementedException();\n",
    "    public ValueTask<Product> GetOnePrivateProductAsync(int productId)\n",
    "    => throw new NotImplementedException();\n",
    "    public ValueTask<IEnumerable<Product>> GetAllPublicProductsAsync()\n",
    "    => throw new NotImplementedException();\n",
    "    public ValueTask<IEnumerable<Product>> GetAllPrivateProductsAsync()\n",
    "    => throw new NotImplementedException();\n",
    "    public ValueTask CreateAsync(Product product)\n",
    "    => throw new NotImplementedException();\n",
    "    public ValueTask UpdateAsync(Product product)\n",
    "    => throw new NotImplementedException();\n",
    "    public ValueTask DeleteAsync(Product product)\n",
    "    => throw new NotImplementedException();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- Be careful not to over-seperate becuase that adds complexity too\n",
    "- Trouble naming a class may indicate a problem with SoC or SRP\n",
    "- Another indicator is that a method or class is too big\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open/closed principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> ”Software entities (classes, modules, functions, and so on) should be open for extension \n",
    "but closed for modification.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- Composition over inheritance\n",
    "    * Compose classes of reusable components rather than inheriting methods\n",
    "    * \"Is a\" vs \"Has a\" relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "    EntityService is tightly coupled to EntityRepository\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> The LSP states that in a program, if we replace an instance of a superclass (supertype) with an instance \n",
    "of a subclass (subtype), the program should not break or behave unexpectedly\n",
    "\n",
    "> In simpler words, if S is a subtype of T, we can replace objects of type T with objects of type S without \n",
    "changing any of the expected behaviors of the program (correctness)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply when using inheritance\n",
    "- Complex requirement to meet it\n",
    "- should be much of a problem when using composition over inheritance\n",
    "- On requirement is that a subtype must pass all tests written for a supertype\n",
    "\n",
    "> The key idea of the LSP is that the consumer of a supertype should remain unaware of whether it’s \n",
    "interacting with an instance of a supertype or an instance of a subtype.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface segregation principle\n",
    "\n",
    "- More small interfaces are better than fewer large interfaces\n",
    "- An interface defines a cohesive contract (methods, properties, and events)\n",
    "- Since C# 8 you can define a default implementation of a method in an interface\n",
